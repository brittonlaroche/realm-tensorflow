| Why TensorFlow?       | 
|-----------------------|
|![TensorFlow](./img/tfLogo2.png)    | 
|TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications. |

|Easy model building                            | Robust ML production anywhere                 |  Powerful experimentation for research        |

|Build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like the layer API, which makes for immediate model iteration and easy debugging.| Easily train and deploy models in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use.|A simple and flexible architecture to take new ideas from concept to code, to state-of-the-art models, and to publication faster.|

## TensorFlow.js

TensorFlow.js is a library for machine learning in JavaScript. Develop ML models in JavaScript, and use ML directly in the browser   

## Getting Started
This project uses Tensorflow.js, MongoDB Realm and Atlas to provide you with everything you need to create a cloud based machine learning platform with nothing more than a modern web browser, and the determination to learn.

## ![1](./img/1b.png) Create an Atlas Cluster
Our first step is to create an atlas cluster. Create a free tier cluster known as an M0. 

Click the following link https://cloud.mongodb.com to sign up. Additional instructions on creating an Atlas cluster are available here: [Atlas getting started Guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/)  

When you create your account you will be asked to create a project.  If you have gone with the default __"Project0"__ then create a new project and name it __"Machine Learning"__.  This is not necessary, but it is good form to clearly identify what your project is.


## ![2](./img/2b.png) Create a Realm Application
Our second step is to create an realm application.
